The degree of collective pessimism gripping us is more desperate and immobilizing than financial imponderables. CWC, a motorcycle trip through the countries starring in the *CRISIS* (PIGS) revealing people and projects which give an optimistic and innovative answer to it.


**BACKGROUND**

October 2012 was the planned date to start this trip, but 2 weeks before
someone stole all the audiovisual equipment from the office, halting the project. In
February 2013, Helena was born, which delayed the trip up to this moment.

This documentary is also a gift for Helena, and all this generation, so that when
she can watch it with analytical capabilities she will spot the world and the context in which
she was born hoping that, in some manner, it will help her face her life.


**WHAT?**

CWC is a documentary portraying the Europe of 2014. A solitary motorcycle
trip from Galicia, in the Iberian Peninsula's extreme northwest,
to the Pireo in Greece, across Portugal, Spain and Italy (PIGS)*.

It's a critical view on the CRISIS. A practical and brave answer to those questions that
we should ask:

**What is the crisis?

Where does it come from?

Where does it lead us?

And now, what?**


**WHY?**

The crisis, which was first a deceleration and now seems like an hecatomb, was supposed to last two
years and it's about to fulfil its sixth. We can't see the light at the end of the tunnel and, if we saw it,
we would think that it was the train coming to finish us. We are frightened and, as the British sociologist Frank Furedi said long before the crisis arose, "ubiquitous and persistent fear generates doom and resignation".

We need to visualize alternative answers, other possible futures, because if we don't
imagine them, we'll never be able to make them happen.


**WHO?**

My name is Xavier Belho and I'm a graphical designer and audiovisual
producer. If I can - with your help - start this project, I'll make a trip
on a motorcycle, a thirdhand Yamaha Virago 1100 from 1997, to shoot a
documentary that will take me from the Galician Fisterra to the gates of the West, through
the countries protagonising the CRISIS (PIGS).

I count on the support of, among others, ExHermanos Karapatrov and the collective
NóComún, Casa das Crechas, Asociación Cidade Vella of Compostela, the Dirty Socks with the soundtrack, and other
collectives and people that will publicly claim their support in the moment
I start this adventure. Along the way I'll be meeting the main characters of this story:
PIGS inhabitants that refuse to see themselves reflected in the mirror of hopelessness
and who face the crisis with courage and great ideas.

**WHERE?**

Where there is an intelligent answer to the crisis.
For now, the route will pass through or close to these cities:

**Santiago de Compostela-Vigo-O Porto-Viseu-Salamanca-Madrid-Toledo-Valencia-Tarragona- Barcelona-Rome-Napoli-Bari-Brindisi-Patras-Athens-Thessaloniki**

**HOW?**

Traveling by motorcycle, I won't be able to afford carrying with me bulky equipment: I'll take
a little videocamera for fullHD recordings, a mini sound
equipment, and a laptop to edit some images on the fly and upload them to the Web
as I'm moving forward.

The project has been planned in a modular structure, with two different stages:

1. The main characters will tell their stories in the places where they are developing them,
directly to the camera through videobooth-style interviews. These
microinterviews will be uploaded to the Web and Social networks, thus building an
interactive map of the trip, with which the audience will be able to interact almost on realtime.

2. Once the trip has ended, a narrative documentary film will be assembled, complementing
those statements selected from the main characters with contextual information and images.

All the documentary material will be licensed under Creative Commons, so that its
images can be used to develop other projects hoping that, whoever bets on this
documentary, will get involved, helping us to broadcast it.

The final documentary film will be presented to international and national
festivals.

**WHERE WILL YOUR SUPPORT GO TO**

The project can't be made without your help. With this campaign, I expect to
cover the basic costs of the trip, such as fuel, videographic material,
the final documentary film's production and post-production to publish, broadcast and share it
with collaborators, as well as Verkami's and Paypal's commissions and rewards' costs.

**SCHEDULE**

If I achieve the requested funds, the project will start in June, with a length of 15
recording days and 20 post-production days. Rewards will be handed out
40 days after the end of the trip.

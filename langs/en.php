				It\'s a documentary portraying the 2012\'s Europe.
			</p>
			<p>
				A trip from Galicia, in the Iberian Peninsula\'s Northwest extreme, 
				to the Pireo in Greece, across Portugal, Spain and Italy (PIGS)*.
				It\'s a critical eye to the CRISIS.
			</p>
			<p>
				A practical and brave answer to that questions we should ask:<br/>
				What is the crisis? <br/>
				Where does it come from?<br/>
				Where does it lead us? <br/>
				And now what?
			</p>');
    define (WHY, '<p>
				The crisis that was a deceleration and now seems an hecatomb
				had to last two years and it\'ll make six. We don\'t see the light
				at the end of the tunnel, and if we saw it we would think that
				it\'s the train coming to finish us.
			</p>
			<p>
				The degree of collective pessimism gripping us is more desperate
				and immobilizer than financial imponderables. We have fear, and as
				british sociologist Frank Furedi said long before the crisis arose,
				ubiquitous and persistent fear generates doom and resignation.
			</p>
			<p>
				We need to visualize alternative answers, other possible futures,
				because if we don\'t imagine them, we will never be able to make
				them happen.

				There where there is an intelligent answer to the crisis.

				For now, the route will pass close to these cities:

				Valencia - Tarragona - Barcelona - Roma - Napoles - Bari - Brindisi - Patras - Atenas</strong>

    define (HOW, '<p>
				The project is planned in two different stages:
				<ol>
					<li>
						The main characters will tell their stories, where they are developing their projects,
						directly to the camera (Canon 7D), through little videobooth style interviews.
						These microinterviews will be uploaded to the Web and Social networks, thus building an
						interactive map of the trip, so the audience will be able to interact almost on realtime.
					</li>
					<li>
						At the end of the trip, a narrative documentary will be built complementing
						selected statements of the main characters with contextual information and images.

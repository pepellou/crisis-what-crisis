A trip from Galicia, in the Iberian Peninsula's Northwest extreme, to the Pireo in Greece, across Portugal, Spain and Italy (PIGS)*.  It's a critical eye to the CRISIS. A practical and brave answer to that questions we should ask: What is the crisis? Where does it come from? Where does it lead us? AND NOW WHAT?");
    define (WHAT, '<p>
Crisis What Crisis is a motorcycle trip through the countries of crisis protagonists (PIGS)*. We want to make visible the people and projects that are taking an optimistic and innovative response. "Crisis What Crisis: A journey through optimistic answers" is a constructive answer against the crisis. A practical and courageous response to new forms of organization and production.

Ours is a journey of shared search by groups and individuals who enjoy the experience more than money. We Will track organizations promoting open knowledge, consumption and cooperation based on a sustainable business model in long-term. Happiness is not what they told us, is what we are expecting.

    define (WHY, '<p>
We live in Southern Europe, in some countries with an authoritarian tradition of which we have recently emerged, with political classes subject to economic power and they have done nothing to improve the welfare of their peoples. They have used policy to generate fast business supported by banking and economic powers. 
			</p>
			<p>
The crisis has been created by the global economic speculation of financial and political sectors. There isn\'t therefore a crisis caused by people and their lack of worker or innovative spirit. The PIGS are not the people who suffer such speculative movements of economic and political power, the PIGS are peoples who have suffered authoritarian regimes, civil wars, repression and violence, and yet are creative, innovative and social people.

Skin thick but tender, it is partly covered with rough bristles and exhibits a wide variety of colors and patterns. Despite its appearance are agile, quick and intelligent animals.”

Here borns CWC to demonstrate that there are a broad based movement that shakes the system tower, this in quotes, with new ideas and ways of relating that are based on sustainability, solidarity, cooperation and freedom.

			<p>
We need to visualize alternative answers, other possible futures, because if we don\'t imagine them, we will never be able to make them happen.

In February 2013 my daughter Helena was born. This documentary is also a gift for her and all this generation. So that when she can see it with analysis capacity she can understand the world she was born and its context, hoping it to serve them in some way to deal with their life.

    define (WHO, '<p>
My name is Xavier Belho and I work in graphic design and audiovisual production. At 23 I left my parents\' house. From that moment I started to do all kinds of activities in order to eat. I sold hams, gave remedial classes to primary school children, I led a pub and I ended up being a Branch Manager. I even worked as graphic designer for a audiovisual production company and mounted a production company with three partners. All these activities were successful and failure ... but none filled me ... until now. So, I\'ve fallen and I always woke up with an idea in his head and little support. At the end of the day ... I am an optimist. Anybody there? The answer I hope to find it in CWC.

If I get launch this project with your help I will make with my Yamaha Virago 1100 \'97 third-hand a motorcycle trip to make a documentary that will take me from the Galicia Finisterre to the gates of the West, through the countries protagonists of the CRISIS (PIGS). CWC is a documentary that portrays the Europe 2014. A motorcycle trip that part from Galicia, in the northwest corner of the Iberian Peninsula and reaches the Piraeus (Athens) in Greece, through Portugal, Spain and Italy (PIGS) *.

I count on the support of the Karapatrov ExBrothers (some of them collaborate unconditionally in the project) and the NóComún collective (they helped in the early stages and help us in spreading), Casa das Crechas (economic and contacts help) Association Cidade Vella de Compostela (disseminate the project), the Dirty Socks with the soundtrack (they are a group of young people who make music in English and with which I collaborated with some designs), NARF (wild musician with whom I went to London to do a photo shoot, to Mozambique to record a video and with who I walk through life with optimism. He will help me in whatever I need), among other groups and individuals who will publicly express their support when the adventure begins.

    define (HOW, '<p>
Since childhood I have liked the travel books, from Jules Verne to Joseph Conrad and particularly Ted Simon\'s book, Jupiter\'s Travels, which narrates his motorcycle trip around the world and their experience along the journey. My love for motorbikes borns from cinema and from a particular movie, Easy Rider, where the motorbike and the trip are one. 
			</p>
			<p>
Now it\'s my turn of take a trip on my old bike, across southern Europe how she did in the fourth century the Egeria traveler, and discover this new world that is being built day day with optimism for a future ruled by truly human values. 
			</p>
			<p>
Traveling by bike I can not afford to carry a bulky team: I will have a small camera that will record video and photos in full HD, one mini sound equipment and a laptop to edit some pictures and upload them to the network as I go along.
			</p>
			<p>
The project is planned as a modular construction with two distinct stages:
				<ol>
					<li>
						The main characters will tell their stories, where they are developing their projects,
						directly to the camera (Canon 7D), through little videobooth style interviews.
						These microinterviews will be uploaded to the Web and Social networks, thus building an
						interactive map of the trip, so the audience will be able to interact almost on realtime.
					</li>
					<li>
						At the end of the trip, a narrative documentary will be built complementing
						selected statements of the main characters with contextual information and images.
					</li>
				</ol>
